# Airport Simulator
## Description
The world's busiest airport, Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport, sees 107 million passengers yearly. With the bustling environment and chaotic operations on the runway, there must exist some system to optimize the takeoff and landing routes to ensure safety and efficiency.This airport simulator was created to solidify concepts in stacks and queues, a foundational concept to web development and machine operations.

**Key concepts: Stacks, Queues, Files, Error-catching, GUIs, OOP**

## Usage

### The simulator begins with an initial set of arrival and takeoff flight numbers.

### When 'START' is pressed, the flights take off at a 2:1 ratio. A countdown simulates buffer time between each operation. A flight animation is played, indicating takeoff/landing.

Landings are prioritized over takeoffs, reflective of real life routing systems.

### User may input new takeoffs and landings. They will be queued to the existing flights. The program continues to run until the user exits the program.
